# Stroke Prediction Web App

This is a user-friendly Streamlit application that predicts the likelihood of a **stroke** based on user health information. The app uses a trained **stacking classifier model** and provides both predictions and **health-related advice**. It also includes a **chatbot assistant** (powered by DeepSeek via OpenRouter API) to answer questions about your results.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Predict stroke risk with personalized input (age, BMI, glucose, etc.)
- Displays stroke probability and risk diagnosis.
- AI chatbot assistant (DeepSeek) to explain results in simple language.
- Real-time feedback and advice on abnormal input values.
- Scikit-learn model and scaler loaded using `joblib`.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Backend**: Python, Scikit-learn, DeepSeek AI via OpenRouter API
- **Model**: Stacking Classifier (pre-trained and serialized)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud

## How It Works

1. The user inputs their medical and lifestyle data.
2. The app preprocesses and scales numerical features (`bmi`, `age`, `avg_glucose_level`).
3. A machine learning model makes a prediction (0 = No Risk, 1 = Risk).
4. A chatbot can be queried for simple health explanations based on the user's data.
