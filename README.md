# Stroke Risk Prediction
We created a function named ‘predict_stroke’ with parameter ‘features’. The ‘predict_stroke’ function is designed to predict the likelihood of stroke based on a set of input features. First, we created a list containing values for the input features required by the model. Next, the function identifies specific features that need to be scaled before making predictions. These features are stored in the list ‘features_to_scale’, which includes 'bmi', 'age' and 'glucose level'. The function then initializes an empty list called ‘scaled_features’ to store the scaled versions of the input features. It iterates through the ‘features’ list. For the first seven features (gender, hypertension, heart disease, ever_married, work_type, residence and smoking status), no scaling is needed, so they are directly appended to ‘scaled_features’. For the remaining features (starting from index 4), the function scales each feature using the corresponding scaler loaded from the ‘scalers’ dictionary which involves:
Retrieving the appropriate scaler for the feature.
Applying the scaler's ‘transform’ method to scale the feature.
Adding the scaled feature to the ‘scaled_features’ list.

Once all features are scaled appropriately, the function uses the pre-trained model to make a prediction. The ‘model.predict’ method is called with the list of ‘scaled_features’. The prediction result is returned as the output of the function, which indicates the likelihood of stroke.
